        <p style=" font-size: 15pt;"> I’m excited to embark on my journey in technology, driven by a passion for computer science and a desire to innovate in artificial intelligence. My fascination began early with math and physics, and deepened in a Java class where I discovered the exciting world of game development. Now, as a freshman at Emerald High School in a computer science essentials class, I’m eager to explore advanced topics and engage in projects that will enhance my skills.</p>

        <p style=" font-size: 15pt;">My experiences in computer science have laid a solid foundation for my aspirations. The Java class allowed me to create games using Visual Studio Code, fueling my enthusiasm for programming. I’m currently expanding my knowledge in my computer science essentials class in which I have learnt to work with MIT app inventor and am currently working with HTML. I plan on participating in coding competitions and seek internships in the future to deepen my understanding of technology and software development.</p>

        <p style=" font-size: 15pt;">During my ninth grade in India, we had a leadership initiative where we underwent interviews with seniors and teachers to secure different posts in our grade. This experience taught me invaluable lessons in communication, critical thinking, and adaptability. Throughout the year, my grade collaborated to plan various events, strengthening my teamwork skills and fostering a sense of inclusivity. As captain of the volleyball team at Emerald High School, I've further developed my leadership abilities, learning the importance of motivation, conflict resolution, and resilience. These experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded leader, able to inspire those around me and tackle challenges with creativity and empathy.</p>

        <p style=" font-size: 15pt;">In conclusion, my passion for computer science, combined with my leadership experiences, has set a strong foundation for a promising career in technology. I’m committed to making a meaningful impact in technology and innovation and excited to embrace future opportunities. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me and my aspirations!</p>
